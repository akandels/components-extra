# CookiesConsent

This component can be one good UI solution for you when you want to handle yourself the interface between your cookies and your users.
**CookiesConsent** provides a light but advanced interface to help you manage your cookies selections.

On desktop screens, the description of the category will be displayed next to the title. On small screens, it will be displayed inside the content of the accordion.

You can append any content to each `<CookiesConsent.Category>`, meaning you can bring
your own table component, or a list, or even a simple paragraph. Here, the `Table` component
is not included in `<CookiesConsent>`, it is a separate component for the sake of the demo.

> **Note:** By default, the Categories are uncontrolled. But you can also chose to control them with a *[checked, onChange]* set of props.
